# Cloud Based Traffic Management System
A traffic monitoring and management system using computer vision (OpenCV) and graph-based algorithms.

## Features
- Vehicle detection from video
- Frame differencing method for counting
- Scalable to real-time CCTV input
- (Future) Dynamic traffic signal adjustment

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies (OpenCV, numpy).
2. Run `python run_counter.py`.
3. Output: bounding boxes around vehicles + count.
